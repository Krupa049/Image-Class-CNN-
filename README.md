# Image Classification Using CNN

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The notebook demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a CNN model for classifying images from a dataset.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset, likely the CIFAR-10 dataset or a similar dataset, that consists of labeled images for classification tasks. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

## Features
- Implementation of a CNN model for image classification.
- Preprocessing of image data including normalization.
- Model architecture defined using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or Keras.
- Training and validation of the model using defined metrics and loss functions.
- Visualization of model performance and predictions.

## Structure of the Notebook
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
    - Load dataset and split it into training and testing subsets.
    - Normalize the image data for input to the CNN model.

2. **Model Design**:
    - Define the architecture of the CNN using layers such as convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

3. **Model Compilation and Training**:
    - Compile the model with appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and metrics.
    - Train the model on the training data and validate its performance.

4. **Evaluation and Visualization**:
    - Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset.
    - Visualize predictions and plot sample results.

## Results
The trained CNN model achieves a reasonable level of accuracy for image classification. Visualization of predictions is included for better understanding.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
